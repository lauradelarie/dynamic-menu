Dynamic BurgerBar Menu -
-----

is an app that enables customers to select and order menu items, foregoing the necessity of ordering with a waiter or waiting in line to order. This app was an assignment of Codaisseur Traineeship, week 8 (final group project).

Aim of this project has been to showcase skills learned during the traineeship, such as:
- building a Ruby on Rails application from the ground up.
- constructing a user interface using Javascript and jQuery.
- authentication a user with devise.
- updating a page asynchronously using AJAX.
- using models and associations and the PostgresQL database.

The database consists of the following tables:
- Users (has_many :orders)
- Orders (belongs_to :user)
- Tables
- Burgers
- Sides
- Toppings
- Sauces
